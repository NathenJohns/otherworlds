Otherworlds E-commerce App - Code Institute Project 5

This is a real-world e-commerce site, built for an artist who designs and makes creatures made from copper and silver wire that are sold all over the world.

Users/customers are able to browse the website, register as a customer, login and view products fully or via their respective categories. They can add items to cart, remove and once happy can checkout using the Stripe payment system.

This website was built for my sister and her business.

# Installation

If you're interested in cloning this repository, to set up and install everything in the requirements.txt run the following command in the terminal:

> $ sudo pip3 -r install requirements.txt

Please note that this project was built using Cloud9, so if another editor is used, the terminal commands may differ. You should consult the documentation of the editor you're using for further information on commands. All secret keys for AWS, Stripe, Production, and Django Settings in Heroku will need to be obtained individually, as they are hidden.

To run the app in Cloud9, open the bash terminal and enter "run" and click enter. This will open a link that can be viewed on Chrome.
